NAME

  Class: pageclass
  Superclass: baseclass
  Include File: <libraries/bgui.h>

FUNCTION

  To provide a gadget which can keep track of "pages" of gadgets of
  which one is displayed at a time. The pages can contain a groupclass
  object which has a set of members or it can contain a single gadget.

  Objects from this class send out the following attribute pairs in
  their notification events:

  PAGE_Active - Currently active page number.

pageclass/GRM_ADDMEMBER

    NAME
	GRM_ADDMEMBER -- Add a object to a page group.

    SYNOPSIS
	err = DoMethod( obj, GRM_ADDMEMBER, member, tag, data, ... );

	ULONG		err;
	Object	       *member;
	Tag		tag;
	ULONG		data;

    FUNCTION
	This method can be used to add a member to an existing page group.

    INPUTS
	member	 - A pointer to the object which you want to add to the group.
	tag,data - This is simply a tagitem array  terminated  by a  TAG_DONE.
		   The following attributes are possible:

		   LGO_Relayout -- Normally the group is layed-out again if adding the
			new member to the group succeeds.  Setting this tag to FALSE prevents
			this so you may do that later calling GRM_RELAYOUT explicitly.

    RESULT
	err	- TRUE uppon success, FALSE uppon failure.

	If this method was successfull you do not need to dispose  of the added
	member anymore. This will be disposed of as soon as the group  to which
	the member was added is disposed of.

	GRM_INSERTMEMBER, GRM_REMMEMBER, GRM_REPLACEMEMBER

pageclass/GRM_INSERTMEMBER

    NAME
	GRM_INSERTMEMBER -- Insert a member behind an existing member.

    SYNOPSIS
	err = DoMethod( obj, GRM_INSERTMEMBER, member, pred, tag, data, ... );

	ULONG		 err;
	Object		*member;
	Object		*pred;
	Tag		 tag;
	ULONG		 data;

    FUNCTION
	This method is basically the same as GRM_ADDMEMBER with the  exception
	that you can determine the object after which the object is added.

    INPUTS
	member	- A pointer to the object to insert.
	pred	- This must point to  the object  after  which the  new member
		is inserted.  You may set this to  NULL in which case  the new
		member is inserted at the start of the list.
	tag,data - Here  you  can  pass  a  set  of  tagitems  in which layout
		specific attributes can  be  defined.	Please	refer  to  the
		GRM_ADDMEMBER section for more	information  on  the available
		attributes.

    RESULT
	err - TRUE uppon success, FALSE uppon failure.

	If this method was successful you do not need to dispose of the added
	member anymore. This will be disposed of as soon as the group to which
	the member was added is disposed of.

pageclass/GRM_REMMEMBER

    NAME
	GRM_REMMEMBER -- Remove an object from the group.

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod( obj, GRM_REMMEMBER, member );

	Object		*member;

    FUNCTION
	To remove  an  object  previously  added  create time or with the
	GRM_ADDMEMBER, GRM_INSERTMEMBER, GRM_REPLACEMEMBER, methods.

    INPUTS
	member	- A pointer to the object which is  to	be  removed  from the
		group.

    RESULT
	No return code specified.

    NOTE
	After  the  object has been removed you are responsible for disposing
	of the removed object.

pageclass/GRM_REPLACEMEMBER

    NAME
	GRM_REPLACEMEMBER -- Replace an object with another.

    SYNOPSIS
	rep = DoMethod( obj, GRM_REPLACEMEMBER, rem, add, tag, data, ... )

	Object		*rep;
	Object		*rem;
	Object		*add;
	Tag		 tag;
	ULONG		 data;

    FUNCTION
	This method can be used to replace a member of a group	with  another
	member.

    INPUTS
	rem	- This should point to the object which is to be replaced.
	add	- This should point to the object which  is  to  replace  the
		object described in "rem".
	tag,data - This  is  an array of attributes which control the way the
		new object is layouted.   The  attributes  allowed  here  are
		exactly the same as  the  attributes  you  can	use  with the
		GRM_ADDMEMBER method.

    RESULT
	rep	- A pointer to the replaced object  uppon  success,  and  NULL
		uppon failure.

	If  this  method  was  successful  you	do not	need to dispose of the
	member which replaces the other member anymore.  This will be disposed
	of as soon as the group to which  the member was added is disposed of.

	You are however responsible to dispose	of  the  object which you have
	replaced.

pageclass/GRM_WHICHOBJECT

    NAME
	GRM_WHICHOBJECT -- Find the object at the specified coordinates.

    SYNOPSIS
	obj = DoMethod( obj, GRM_WHICHOBJECT, xy );

	Object		*obj;
	ULONG		 xy;

    FUNCTION
	This method  should  be  used  to  find  out which object  is  located
	under  the  given  X/Y coordinates.

    INPUTS
	xy	- A 32bit  unsigned  integer  which   holds   the   horizontal
		coordinate in the upper 16 bits  and the  vertical  coordinate
		in the lower 16 bits. The coordinates  should  be  relative to
		the upper-left corner of the window.

    NOTE
	Please	note  that this method will only work properly when the window
	in which the page group is located is open.

	This method is primarily used for the tool tips but may also be useful
	for the application programmer.

    RESULT
	Returns the object under the coordinates or NULL if there is no object
	under the given coordinates.

pageclass/OM_DISPOSE

NAME

  OM_DISPOSE

FUNCTION

  When this method is called it will also dispose of all
  pages of objects attached to this object.


pageclass/PAGE_Active

NAME

  PAGE_Active -- ( ULONG )

FUNCTION

  Set the page number currently active (I.E. displayed on the window).
  The active page is the only page that can receive input.

DEFAULT

  0.

APPLICABILITY

  (ISGNU).

pageclass/PAGE_Inverted

NAME

  PAGE_Inverted -- ( BOOL )

FUNCTION

  To force the members added at create time to be AddHead()'ed to the
  member list instead of AddTail()'ed. This is necessary for the
  assembly macros of the BGUI package.

DEFAULT

  FALSE.

APPLICABILITY

  (I).

pageclass/PAGE_Member

NAME

  PAGE_Member -- ( Object * )

FUNCTION

  To add a page of gadgets. The object may be a groupclass object having
  any number of members or it may be a single gadget object.

DEFAULT

  NULL.

APPLICABILITY

  (I).

pageclass/PAGE_NoBufferRP

NAME

  PAGE_NoBufferRP -- ( BOOL )

FUNCTION

  When this attribute is set to TRUE the pageclass will tell the
  layout engine not to setup a buffer RastPort which means that all
  rendering occurs on-screen. This may be handy when you use objects
  which take some time to render like the colorwheel.gadget on 256
  colour screens.

DEFAULT

  FALSE.

APPLICABILITY

  (I).
