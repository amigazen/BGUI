NAME

    Class:     popbuttonclass
    Superclass: baseclass
    Include File:  <libraries/bgui.h>

FUNCTION

    To provide you with a class similar  to the  cycle  class in  pop-menu
    mode. This class however appears to be a button gadget which will snap
    down a menu for the user to select an entry without  changing anything
    to the apperance of the object itself.

    Also a checkable (toggle)  mode  with or  without mutual  exclusion is
    supported.

    Sunmouse/Sunkey/AutoPopWindowToFront etc. tools  may  cause  confusion
    in combination with this class. When another window is activated while
    the popmenu is up  intuition will  automatically  deactivate  the menu
    selection.

    Objects  from  this  class  send out  the following attribute pairs in
    their notification messages:

    GA_ID            - Gadget object ID.
    PMB_MenuNumber   - Number of the selected menu.

NEW METHODS

    PMBM_CHECK_STATUS -- This method must  be  used to  see if  a  menu is
            checked or not.   The  following  custom  message structure is
            used:

            struct pmbmCommand {
                    ULONG                MethodID;
                    ULONG                pmbm_MenuNumber;
            };

            pmbm_MenuNumber -- This must be the ordinal number of the menu
                    on which the action is done. Please note that you must
                    make sure that this value  is in  range  otherwise you
                    definitly will get enforcer hits.

            Returns TRUE when the menu is checked and FALSE if not.

    PMBM_CHECK_MENU -- Use this method to check a menu.   It uses the same
            message structure as PMB_CHECK_STATUS.

    PMBM_UNCHECK_MENU -- Use this method to un-check a menu.  It  uses the
            same message structure as PMB_CHECK_STATUS.

    PMBM_ENABLE_ITEM -- Use this method to enable a menu item. It uses
            the same message structure as PMB_CHECK_STATUS. Added by
            NMC (12.12.95).

    PMBM_DISABLE_ITEM -- Use this method to disable a menu item. It uses
            the same message structure as PMB_CHECK_STATUS. Added by
            NMC (12.12.95).

    PMBM_ENABLE_STATUS -- Use this method to find out if a menu item
            is enabled or disabled. It uses the same message structure
            as PMB_CHECK_STATUS. Added by NMC (12.12.95).

            Returns TRUE when the menu is enabled and FALSE if not.


CHANGED METHODS

    None.


popbuttonclass/Attributes

NOTE

    All  baseclass  attributes  are  also  valid  for this class. Also the
    vectorclass attributes can be used with  OM_SET on objects  from  this
    class.


NAME

    PMB_Image -- ( struct Image * )

FUNCTION

    To provide the object with a standard Intuition image or BOOPSI image.
    The image will be centered inside the object it's hitbox.   This  will
    override any vectorclass image.

    Default is NULL. Applicability is (IS).


NAME

    PMB_MenuEntries -- ( UBYTE ** )

FUNCTION

    To   specify  the  actual  menu  entries.     This  must  point  to an
    array of PopMenu structures. The array must be terminated with  a NULL
    pm_Label entry.

    struct PopMenu {
            UBYTE  *pm_label;
            UWORD   pm_Flags;
            ULONG   pm_MutualExclude;
    };

    pm_Label -- This should be a pointer to  a  0-terminated  string which
            contains the text for this menu.  You can specify PMB_BARLABEL
            here to get a seperator bar simular to the seperator  bar used
            by gadtools. If you make this NULL the array is terminated.

    pm_Flags -- The following two flags are supported:

            PMF_CHECKIT -- When set, this flag tell's the class  that this
                    menu should toggle it's selected  status.  A checkmark
                    image is shown when the menu is selected.

            PMF_CHECKED -- When set the menu is selected.

            PMF_DISABLED -- When set, the menu item is disabled and
                    cannot be selected by the user. If it's a check
                    item, it can still be checked and unchecked by
                    the application). Added by NMC (12.12.95).

    pm_MutualExclude -- This 32 bit value can  hold bits  which  represent
            menus which should be de-selected when this menu is checked.

            Each set bit means to  exclude        a menu.  I.E. When bit four is
            set the fourth menu is de-selected if it is a  checkable item.

            NOTE: Mutually-excluded   items   will *not* trigger   any
            notification so you are responsible to keep track of this.

            Please take a look at the supplied demo for a working example.

    The class will make a private copy of the PopMenu  array so  the menus
    may be used on more than one object.

    Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).


NAME

    PMB_MenuNumber -- ( ULONG )

FUNCTION

    This  attribute  holds  the  ordinal number of the last selected menu.
    When your application is notified  by the  gadget  you  should  OM_GET
    this attribute to find out which menu was selected.

    Applicability is (GN).


NAME

    PMB_PopPosition -- ( ULONG )

FUNCTION

    To make the class pop the menu  with a  specific  entry as  the  first
    one activated. When the object is activated by a mouse-click  the menu
    will try to open with the specified item under the mouse pointer. Key-
    board activation will simple pop the menu with the item selected.

    NMC (10.12.95) - Specifying a PMB_PopPosition of ~0 makes the menu
    always open under the object, even when activated by a mouse-click.

    Applicability is (I).
