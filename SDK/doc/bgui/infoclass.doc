    NAME
	Class:		infoclass
	Superclass:	baseclass
	Include File:	<libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
	To  provide  a	general  multi-line  text gadget which can be used for
	on-line  help  or  general information purposes. It has the ability to
	handle	different  text  style,  colors  and text justifications. Also
	C-style formatting codes are allowed.

	A  good  example  of  the  usage  of this class is the BGUI_RequestA()
	routine.  This	routine  uses  an infoclass object to display the body
	text.

	This gadget does not send out notification events.

infoclass/INFO_Args

    NAME

    FUNCTION
	Set  the arguments accoording to the C-style formatting codes found in
	the text.

    DEFAULT
	NULL.

infoclass/INFO_FixTextWidth

    NAME
	INFO_FixTextWidth -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
	To tell the object that it's minimum width may not be smaller than the
	width  of  the	longest  line  in the text plus the offsets and border
	thickness.

    DEFAULT
	FALSE.

    APPLICABILITY
	(I).

infoclass/INFO_MinLines

    NAME
	INFO_MinLines -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	Set  the  minimum  number  of  lines  the object should display at all
	times.	This  is  taken into consideration when to object it's minimum
	size is calculated.

    DEFAULT

infoclass/INFO_TextFormat

    NAME
	INFO_TextFormat -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	Set  the  textual  contents  of the gadget object. You can use C-style
	formatting  codes in the text and in addition to that you may also use
	any of the following command sequences:

	STYLE OPTIONS
	\33b	- Bold text on.			\33-b	- Bold text off.
	\33i	- Italic text on.		\33-i	- Italic text off.
	\33u	- Underlined text on.		\33-u	- Underlined text off.
	\33s	- Shadowed text on.		\33-s	- Shadowed text off.
	\33n	- Normal text.

	JUSTIFICATION OPTIONS
	\33c	- Center this and the following lines.
	\33l	- Left-justify this and the following lines.
	\33r	- Right-justify this and the following lines.

	The \33c, \33l and \33r command sequences can only be used at the
	beginning of a new line.

	PEN OPTIONS
	\33p[n]	- Set pen [n].			\33P[n] - Set back pen [n].
	\33d[n]	- Set dri pen [n].		\33D[n] - Set back dripen [n].

	MISCELLANEOUS
	\n	- Start a new line of text.
	\33k  - Keep color and formatting changes between lines.
	\33w  - Make text wrap if when it is too large to fit.
	\331  - Make text be rendered in JAM1 mode.
	\332  - Make text be rendered in JAM2 mode.
	\33C  - Make text be rendered in COMPLEMENT mode.
	\33z	- Label lined text on.		\33-z	- Label lined text off.
	\33Z	- Label highlined text on.	\33-Z	- Label highlined text off.
	
	The \33z and \33-z attributes are used by the labelclass for underlining
	key equivalents specified with the underscore character.  Use these if
	you want to indicate a key equivalent longer than one character.  The
	\33Z and \33-Z attributes will render the underline in the SHINEPEN.

	Since V38 of the library it is possible to use locale's FormatString()
	formatting  codes.  Locale specific formatting codes will only work
	when the locale.library is available.

    DEFAULT
	NULL.
