    NAME
	Class:		aslreqclass
	Superclass:	rootclass
	Include File:	<bgui/bgui_asl.h>

    FUNCTION
	To  provide  a	BOOPSI	interface  class to all ASL requesters.  This
	class  is  the  superclass  of  the  filereqclass,  fontreqclass  and
	screenreqclass.  All ASL attributes are tracked by this class.

	This class is probably only directly useful to class implementors.

    NOTE
	All  the  ASL requester attributes as defined in <libraries/asl.h> are
	usable  with  this class.  Applicability for  these ASL  attributes is
	(ISGU).

    SEE ALSO
	<libraries/asl.h>

aslreqclass/ASLM_ALLOCREQUEST

    NAME
	ASLM_ALLOCREQUEST -- Allocate the requester structure.

    FUNCTION
	A low-level method, mainly useful to class implementors.  Allocates
	and initializes the ASL requester, and returns a pointer to it, or
	NULL if it fails to allocate the memory.
	
    SEE ALSO
	ASLM_DOREQUEST, ASLM_REQUEST, ASLM_FREEREQUEST

aslreqclass/ASLM_DOREQUEST

    NAME
	ASLM_DOREQUEST -- Popup the requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	rc = DoMethod( obj, ASLM_DOREQUEST );

	ULONG		rc;

    FUNCTION
	Sending this method to the object will open the requester.

    INPUTS
	None.

    RESULT
	rc	- Any of the following return codes:

		ASLREQ_OK -- Ok. No problems.

		ASLREQ_CANCEL -- The requester was cancelled by the user.

		ASLREQ_ERROR_NO_MEM -- Out of memory.

		ASLREQ_ERROR_NO_REQ -- It was not possible  for  the  object  to
			allocate a requester structure.

    EXAMPLE
	Object		*req;
	ULONG		 rc;

	/*
	 *	Open up a requester.
	 */
	rc = DoMethod( req, ASLM_DOREQUEST );

	switch ( rc ) {
		...
	}

aslreqclass/ASLM_FREEREQUEST

    NAME
	ASLM_FREEREQUEST -- Allocate the requester structure.

    FUNCTION
	A low-level method, mainly useful to class implementors.  Frees the
	ASL requester if it was previously allocated.  No return value defined.
	
    SEE ALSO
	ASLM_DOREQUEST, ASLM_ALLOCREQUEST, ASLM_REQUEST

aslreqclass/ASLM_REQUEST

    NAME
	ASLM_REQUEST -- Open the requester.

    FUNCTION
	A low-level method, mainly useful to class implementors.  Pops up the
	ASL requester that was initialized by the ASLM_ALLOCREQUEST method.
	Does not free the requester.
	
	This method will return FALSE on failure or cancellation, non-zero if
	successful.

	A typical ASLM_DOREQUEST method looks like this:
	
		struct FileRequester *req;
		
		req = (struct FileRequester *)DoMethodA(obj, ASLM_ALLOCREQUEST);
		
		SetAttrsA(obj, myAslTags);	// Any tags you want to set
		DoMethodA(obj, ASLM_REQUEST);
		
		strcpy(FileBuffer, req->fr_File);	// Get what you need
		
		DoMethodA(obj, ASLM_FREEREQUEST);	// Free it

aslreqclass/OM_SET

    NAME
	OM_SET -- Set attributes.

    FUNCTION
	Set attributes of the filerequester.  This method will return 0 if the
	attributes were set OK. On  failure it will return ASLREQ_ERROR_NO_MEM
	indicating that the change could not be made.

aslreqclass/ASLREQ_[Left,Top,Width,Height]

    NAME
	ASLREQ_Left, ASLREQ_Top, ASLREQ_Width, ASLREQ_Height -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	To obtain the current position and size of the filerequester.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

aslreqclass/ASLREQ_Type

    NAME
	ASLREQ_Type -- ( ULONG ) ** V40 **

    FUNCTION
    	To specify the type of ASL requester.  See <libraries/asl.h> for the
    	types available.

    DEFAULT
	ASL_FileRequester.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).
