NAME

  Class:      vectorclass
  Superclass: IMAGECLASS
  Include File: <libraries/bgui.h>

FUNCTION

  To provide you with an easy way to create simple, fully scalable
  images. The image consists of an array of small structures which
  contains coordinates and command flags.

vectorclass/VIT_BuiltIn

NAME

  VIT_BuiltIn -- ( ULONG )

FUNCTION

  Set or get any of the built-in images. You can select any of the
  following images:

  BUILTIN_GETPATH -- Also known as a folder image. This image is usually
    used in a button which pops up a filerequester to select a drawer.

  BUILTIN_GETFILE -- This image is usually used in a button which pops
    up a filerequester to select a file.

  BUILTIN_CHECKMARK -- Standard, fully scalable, checkmark/checkbox
    image.

  BUILTIN_POPUP -- This image is usually used in a button which pops up
    a requester to select some sort of data like screen mode, fonts etc.

  BUILTIN_ARROW_UP -- An up arrow image.

  BUILTIN_ARROW_DOWN -- A down arrow image.

  BUILTIN_ARROW_LEFT -- A left arrow image.

  BUILTIN_ARROW_RIGHT -- A right arrow image.

DEFAULT

  0 (none).

APPLICABILITY

  (ISG).

vectorclass/VIT_DriPen

NAME

  VIT_DriPen -- ( UWORD )

FUNCTION

  Set or get the drawinfo pen used to render the image.

DEFAULT

  ~0.

vectorclass/VIT_VectorArray

NAME

  VIT_VectorArray -- ( struct VectorItem * )

FUNCTION

  Set or get a pointer to an array of VectorItem structures. The
  VectorItem structure is a small structure which contains information
  on the coordinates and command flags.

  struct VectorItem {
    WORD  vi_x;
    WORD  vi_y;
    ULONG vi_Flags;
  };

  vi_x -- This field contains either the x-coordinate of the next point
    or other data depending which command flags are set in the
    vi_Flags field.

  vi_y -- This field contains either the y-coordinate of the next point
    or other data depending which command flags are set in the
    vi_Flags field.

  vi_Flags -- This field can contain any of the following flags:

    VIF_MOVE -- Move to the location described in vi_x and vi_y.

    VIF_DRAW -- Draw to the location described in vi_x and vi_y.

    VIF AREASTART -- Start area-filling at the location described
      in vi_x, vi_y. All VIF_MOVE and VIF_DRAW commands will now
      AreaMove() and AreaDraw().

    VIF_AREAEND -- End area-filling at the location described in
      vi_x, vi_y. All VIF_MOVE and VIF_DRAW commands will now
      Move() and Draw().

    VIF_XRELRIGHT -- vi_x is relative to the right image border.

    VIF_YRELBOTTOM -- vi_yis relative to the bottom image border.

    VIF_SHADOWPEN -- Set the SHADOWPEN and move/draw.

    VIF_SHINEPEN -- Set the SHINEPEN and move/draw.

    VIF_FILLPEN -- Set the FILLPEN and move/draw.

    VIF_TEXTPEN -- Set the TEXTPEN and move/draw.

    VIF_COLOR -- Set the pen described in vi_x. No move/draw.

    VIF_LASTITEM -- This flag terminates the VectorItem array.
      This flag _must_ be set in the last VectorItem of the
      array as it's the only way for the class to know when
      it has reached the end.

    VIF_SCALE -- vi_x and vi_y contain the design size of the
      image. The design size usually is the size of the image
      when using a 8x8 font.  Without this information the image
      cannot and will not scale.

    VIF_DRIPEN -- Set the drawinfo pen described in vi_x. No move/
      draw. See <intuition/screens.h> about drawinfo pens.

    VIF_AOLPEN -- Set the area-outline pen to the pen described in
      vi_x. No move/draw.

    VIF_AOLDRIPEN -- Set the area-outline pen to the drawinfo pen
      described in vi_x. No move/draw. See <intuition/screens.h>
      about drawinfo pens.

    VIF_ENDOPEN -- Terminate the area-outline mode.

DEFAULT

  NULL.
