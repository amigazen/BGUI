    NAME
	Class:		indicatorclass
	Superclass:	baseclass
	Include File:	<libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
	To  provide  a	textual level indicator for gadget objects which might
	need this like the slider and progress classes. As this class may also
	be  useful  in	conjunction with other third party classes it has been
	made available.

	Objects of this class do not send out notification events.

indicatorclass/INDIC_FormatString

    NAME
	INDIC_FormatString -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	Set  the  C-style  format  string  which is used to format the current
	level before rendering.

	NOTE: Since  V38  of  the  library  it	is  possible  to  use locale's
	      FormatString()  formatting  codes.  Locale  specific  formatting
	      codes will only work when the locale.library is available.

    DEFAULT
	"%ld".

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISGU).

    NOTE
	Setting the format string neither updates the minimum size nor redraws
	the object. It is better to set it only when the window is closed.
