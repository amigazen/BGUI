progressclass/--background--

NAME

  Class: progressclass
  Superclass: baseclass
  Include File: <libraries/bgui.h>

FUNCTION

  To provide a progression indicator in the form of a fuel gauge.
  Objects from this class will send out the following attribute pairs in
  notification events:

  GA_ID - Gadget object ID.
  PROGRESS_Done - Current level of progression.


progressclass/PROGRESS_Divisor

NAME

  PROGRESS_Divisor -- ( ULONG )

FUNCTION

  Set a divisor which is used to divide the level of progression before
  it is rendered. This is necessary when the progression minimum and
  maximum levels are very far apart (I.E. 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF). This way a
  fairly accurate progression is displayed.


progressclass/PROGRESS_Done

NAME

  PROGRESS_Done -- ( LONG )

FUNCTION

  Set or update the current level of progression.

DEFAULT

  0.

APPLICABILITY

  (ISGNU).

SEE ALSO

  PROGRESS_Min, PROGRESS_Max

progressclass/PROGRESS_FormatString

NAME

  PROGRESS_FormatString -- ( STRPTR )

FUNCTION

  Set the C-style format string which is used to format the current
  progression. By default this tag is set to NULL which means that no
  textual progression is rendered in the object. When this points to a
  0-terminated C-style format string a textual progression is rendered
  in the object.

NOTE:

  Since V38 of the library it is possible to use locale's
  FormatString() formatting codes. Locale specific formatting
  codes will only work when the locale.library is available.

DEFAULT

  NULL.

APPLICABILITY

  (I).

SEE ALSO

  exec.library/RawDoFmt(), PROGRESS_Done

progressclass/PROGRESS_Max

NAME

  PROGRESS_Max - ( LONG )

FUNCTION

  Set maximum possible progression.

DEFAULTS

  100.

APPLICABILITY

  (IS).

SEE ALSO

  PROGRESS_Min, PROGRESS_Done

progressclass/PROGRESS_Min

NAME

  PROGRESS_Min - ( LONG )

FUNCTION

  Set the minimum possible progression.

DEFAULT

  0.

APPLICABILITY

  (IS).

SEE ALSO

  PROGRESS_Max, PROGRESS_Done

progressclass/PROGRESS_Vertical

NAME

  PROGRESS_Vertical -- ( BOOL )

FUNCTION

  To make the indication vertical. By default the gauge is horizontal
  which is filled from left to right. A vertical gauge is filled from
  bottom to top.

DEFAULT

  FALSE.

APPLICABILITY

  (I).
