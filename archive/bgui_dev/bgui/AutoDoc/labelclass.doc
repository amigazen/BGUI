    NAME
	Class:		labelclass
	Superclass:	BGUI_IMAGE_OBJECT
	Include File:	<bgui/bgui_image.h>

    FUNCTION
	To  provide  a	general  labeling  image. It supports underscoring and
	placement  of  the label similar to the gadtools gadget labels. It can
	do multi-line labels.

labelclass/IM_EXTENT

    NAME
	IM_EXTENT -- Get label/hitbox extentions.

    SYNOPSIS
	DoMethod( obj, IM_EXTENT, rp, extent, width, height, flags )

	struct RastPort         *rp;
	struct IBox		*extent;
	UWORD			*width;
	UWORD			*height;
	UWORD			 flags;

    FUNCTION
	This  method will ask a labelclass object for the amount of pixels the
	label extends the image bounding box.	Normally  this	method is only
	used by the baseclass which handles labels but in some cases you might
	need this method for yourself.

    INPUTS
	rp	- This	must  point  to  the RastPort in which the label is to
		be rendered.  It  is copied to an internal buffer  and on that
		copy  font  changes  and  calculations	will  be  made	so the
		RastPort you pass here remains unchanged. This must be valid.

	extent	- This	 field	 is   used  to	store  the  label  extentions.
		The label extentions are simply the  number  of  pixels  which
		the label extends the image bounding box  in either direction.
		The Left and Top fields will always be	smaller  than or equal
		to zero. The Width and Height  fields  will always be equal to
		or bigger than zero. This must be valid.

	width,
	height	- In  these  pointers  the total pixel width and height of the
		label are stored. This must be valid.

	flags	- This value field may contain any of the following flags:

		EXTF_MAXIMUM -- Normally   when  this  method  is  called  the
			returned values are the extentions as they  are at the
			moment you call this method.   When this flag  is  set
			the   returned	 values   are	the  maximum  possible
			extentions  the  label	can have.

		Please note that this value is only 16 bits.

    RESULT
	No return code defined.

labelclass/LAB_Flags

    NAME
	LAB_Flags -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	Set or get  the flag settings of the label.   The  following flags are
	possible:

	LABF_HIGHLIGHT --  Normally  the  label  is  rendered  in  the TEXTPEN
		or FILLTEXTPEN color.  When this  flag	is  set  the  label is
		rendered in the HIGHLIGHTTEXTPEN color.

	LABF_HIGH_USCORE -- This is the  same  as  LABF_HIGHLIGHT only now the
		color of the underscoring is affected.

    DEFAULT
	0.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

    FUNCTION
	Set or clear the LABF_HIGHLIGHT flag.

    FUNCTION
	Set or clear the LABF_HIGH_USCORE flags.

    DEFAULT
	FALSE.

labelclass/LAB_Label

    NAME
	LAB_Label -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	Set or get the actual text for the label.  This may contain standard
	infoclass command sequences, and be multiple lines.

    DEFAULT
	NULL.

labelclass/LAB_LabelID

    NAME
	LAB_LabelID -- ( ULONG ) ** V41 **

    FUNCTION
	Set or get the ID for LAB_Label.  BASE_LOCALIZE uses this to set LAB_Label.

    DEFAULT
	0.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

    SEE ALSO
	LAB_Label, baseclass.doc/BASE_LOCALIZE

labelclass/LAB_Place

    NAME
	LAB_Place -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	Set or get the place relative to the  image  bounding box at which the
	label is rendered. The following places are possible:

	PLACE_IN -- The label is centered inside the image bounds.

	PLACE_LEFT -- The  label  is  placed  left  of	the  image  bounds and
		centered vertically.

	PLACE_RIGHT -- The  label  is  placed  right  of the  image bounds and
		centered vertically.

	PLACE_ABOVE -- The label is placed above the image bounds and centered
		horizontally.

	PLACE_BELOW -- The label is placed below the image bounds and centered
		horizontally.

    DEFAULT
	PLACE_IN.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

labelclass/LAB_Style

    NAME
	LAB_Style -- ( UWORD )

    FUNCTION
	Set or get  the style as defined in <graphics/text.h> which is used to
	render the font. Note that this style overrides the style of  the font
	passed by the LAB_TextAttr attribute.

    DEFAULT
	FS_NORMAL.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

    SEE ALSO
	LAB_TextAttr, <graphics/text.h>

labelclass/LAB_Template

    NAME
	LAB_Template -- ( Object * )

    FUNCTION
	Copy all of the attributes of one labelclass object to another labelclass
	object.  This allows for fast duplication of many label attributes at one
	time.  You may free the template object afterwards.
	
    DEFAULT
	NULL.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG)

    SEE ALSO


labelclass/LAB_TextAttr

    NAME
	LAB_TextAttr -- ( struct TextAttr * )

    FUNCTION
	Set  or  get  the  font that is to be used to render the label. Please
	note  that the font you pass here is opened with OpenFont() so it must
	be in memory already.

    DEFAULT
	NULL.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

labelclass/LAB_Underscore

    NAME
	LAB_Underscore -- ( UBYTE )

    FUNCTION
	Set or get  the  character that marks the character to be underscored.
	Normally the underscore character is used to mark a key  which can be
	used to control the gadget. Example:

		LAB_Underscore, '@'

		Will underscore the 'O' character in the following label:

		"@Open"

    DEFAULT
	'_' (V41), 0 (<V41).

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).

labelclass/LAB_[#?]Pen

   NAME
	LAB_Pen, LAB_DriPen, LAB_SelectedPen, LAB_SelectedDriPen -- ( UWORD )
	** V39 **

   FUNCTION
	To specify the colors of a label.  The	LAB_xxxPen  attributes must be
	used  to  specify  the pen number of the used color. The LAB_xxxDriPen
	attributes  must  be  used  to specify the DrawInfo pen number to use.
	You can specify two colors: the text  color of the label in the normal
	unselected state and the text color of the label in the selected
	state.

	Specifying ~0 (-1) for the pens will deactivate  the  text  color  and
	the class will fall back to the default coloring sceme.

    DEFAULTS
	~0.

    APPLICABILITY
	(ISG).
